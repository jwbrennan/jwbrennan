# Joseph Brennan

## Technical Consultant

I took an interest in programming while studying astrophysics at the University of St Andrews.
My Master's thesis was related to gravitational microlensing, specifically the extreme low-mass limits of what we might able to detect with next-generation ELTs by exploiting the finite-source effect for sources like white dwarfs. My supervisor was Dr. Martin Dominik.
